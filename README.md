# A C# deep learning library

Developing a C# wrapper to help developer easily create and train deep neural network models.

* Easy to use library, just focus on research
* CUDA supported, no seperate package for each cuda version. supported so far: 8, 9.0, 9.1, 9.2, 10
* Light weight libray, built with .NET standard 2.0
* Code well structured, easy to extend if you would like to extend with new layer, loss, metrics, optimizers, constraints, regularizer
