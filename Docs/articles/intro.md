# About the library

SiaNet is developed with keeping in mind to reduce the burden of learning mathmatical intricacies. 
You will find the similarity with popular python library "Keras". It is a high-level deep learning library developed in C#. 
Similar to Keras it will support various backend: CNTK, TensorFlow, MxNet, ArrayFire, TensorSharp etc. 
It is designed to enable fast experimentation with deep neural networks with focus on user-friendly API, modularity and extensibility.

Few dot point of SiaNet

* Easy to use API, just focus on research
* Multiple backends – ArrayFire (In Progress), TensorSharp (In Progress), CNTK (Not Started), TensorFlow (Not Started), MxNet (Not Started)
* CUDA / OpenCL support for some of the backends
* Lightweight library, built with .NET standard 2.0
* Code well structured, easy to extend if you would like to extend with new layer, loss, metrics, optimizers, constraints, regularizer
